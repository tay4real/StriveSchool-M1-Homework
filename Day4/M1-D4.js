/* EXERCISE 1
Write a function "area" which receives 2 parameters (l1,l2) and calculate the area of the rectangle.
*/

const area = (l1, l2) => {
  return l1 * l2;
};

/* EXERCISE 2
Write a function "crazySum" which receives two given integers. If the two values are same, then returns triple their sum.
*/
const crazySum = (int1, int2) => {
  if (typeof int1 === "number" && typeof int2 === "number") {

    }
  }
};

//console.log(crazySum(3, 3));

/* EXERCISE 3
Write a function "crazyDiff" that computes the 
absolute difference between a given number and 19. 
Returns triple their absolute difference if 
the specified
number is greater than 19.
*/

const crazyDiff = (num) => {

    }
  }
};

// console.log(crazyDiff(20));

/* EXERCISE 4
Write a function "boundary" which accept an integer N and returns true if N is within 20 and 100 (included) or equal to 400.
